# ðŸ¦€ Rust Proposal: LTSS â€” Long Term Sustain Support

> A formal proposal toward a long-term, industrial-grade Rust ecosystem  
> for compiler independence, stability, and sustainability.

## Overview
Rust-Proposal-LTSS defines a vision, governance, and roadmap for long-term Rust stability.
It bridges industrial demand and compiler innovation through R3C, Rust-LTSS, and Beyond-LLVM projects.

## Structure
- `proposal/` â€” Technical & architectural proposals
- `whitepaper/` â€” Research and comparative analyses
- `governance/` â€” Community and foundation collaboration models

## Goal
Enable a **10-year sustainable Rust toolchain** free from LLVM volatility,  
driven by open collaboration and transparent governance.
