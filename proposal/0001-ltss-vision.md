# Proposal 0001 — Vision of Rust LTSS (Long Term Sustain Support)

## Abstract
Rust LTSS defines a sustainable long-term branch of the Rust ecosystem  
to guarantee stability, reproducibility, and compiler independence  
beyond LLVM constraints and nightly churn.

## Motivation
Rust's rapid evolution introduces frequent breaking changes.  
Industrial and embedded developers need long-term compiler and crate stability.

## Vision
- LLVM-free optional backend (via R3C)
- 10-year stability horizon
- Unified build reproducibility system
- Embedded and industrial Rust continuity

## Alignment
Rust LTSS aligns with:
- R3C Compiler (C++ → Rust → NASM)
- LLVM-Zero Ecosystem
- Rust-LTSS Core Releases
