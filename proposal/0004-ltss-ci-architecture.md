# Proposal 0004 — CI Architecture for Rust LTSS Validation

## Objective
Establish a continuous validation system to ensure stability of compilers and crates under LTSS.

## Architecture Overview

Source → Build Pipeline → LTSS Validator → Release Mirror → Artifact Archive

## Key Points
- Auto recompile every 30 days  
- Detect LLVM breakages → R3C fallback  
- Produce `ltss-metrics.json` for dashboard visualization  
- Verify reproducible builds across platforms
